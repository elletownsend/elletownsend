# Hi, I'm Elle :sparkles:

![A profile photo of me](gh-readme-header.png)
I'm a Software Engineer with a love of all things tech! This is my GitHub profile, where I keep the code for my portfolio website, and a mish-mash of other projects I've worked on over the years. 

I love working with front-end web tech like JavaScript, HTML and CSS, but you'll also find me coding in Python and C# too.
