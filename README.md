# Hi, I'm Elle :sparkles:
![A profile photo of me](https://github.com/elletownsend/elletownsend/blob/master/gh-readme-header.png)
I'm a Software Engineer with a love of all things tech! This is my GitHub profile, where I keep the code for my portfolio website, and a mish-mash of other projects I've worked on over the years. 

I love working with front-end web tech like JavaScript, HTML and CSS, but you might also find me coding in Python.
